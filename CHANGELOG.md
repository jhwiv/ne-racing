# NE Racing — Upgrade Changelog (2026-04-14)

## Part 1: CSS Navigation Bug Fix
- **Moved** `#desktop-nav { display: none; }` **before** the `@media (min-width: 768px)` query so the responsive rule properly overrides on desktop
- Desktop nav (Today, Bets, Handicap, Results, Reference) now renders at ≥768px
- Mobile bottom tab bar continues to render at <768px — verified at 375px viewport

## Part 2: Enriched JSON Data Format
- Added `race_type_code` to each race object (MCL, CLM, MSW, AOC, ALW)
- Added per-horse fields: `ml`, `speedFigs`, `runningStyle`, `jockeyPct`, `trainerPct`, `lastClass`
- All 70 horses across 8 races populated with researched data from Equibase, NYRA, DRF, and BloodHorse sources
- Jockey win percentages based on trailing 12-month NYRA circuit stats (21 jockeys)
- Trainer win percentages from NYRA meet leaders (23 trainers from research + reasonable estimates for 24 smaller barns)
- Beyer Speed Figures sourced from past performances; estimated from class level for horses without published figs
- Running styles assigned from past-performance running lines

## Part 3: Updated `transformStaticEntries()` + `mapRaceTypeToCode()`
- Added `mapRaceTypeToCode()` helper that fuzzy-matches race_type strings ("Maiden Claiming" → "MCL", etc.)
- Updated `transformStaticEntries()` to map `race_type_code` directly, falling back to `mapRaceTypeToCode(race_type)`
- Horse mapping now includes: `id`, `speedFigs`, `runningStyle`, `jockeyPct`, `trainerPct`, `lastClass`, `notes`, `wps`
- Race `type` field now resolves to CLASS_SCALE-compatible codes

## Part 4: Recommended Bets Card + Pass Logic
- **New card** (`#rec-bets-card`) replaces the old Top Picks card at the top of the Today tab
- **Best Bet of the Day**: Horse with highest composite score where gap > 15 (High confidence). Falls back to widest gap with Medium/Low label
- **Value Plays**: Horses ranked #1 or #2 with ML ≥ 5-1 AND composite score ≥ 65. Includes exacta box suggestion with #2 horse
- **Pass Races**: Any race where score gap < 7 between #1 and #2 is marked "PASS — No clear edge. Save your bankroll."
- **Daily Ticket Summary**: Shows estimated cost, daily budget (20% of bankroll), and remaining budget
- Suggested bet amount: 5% of bankroll for Best Bet
- Visual style matches racing green/gold/white design language
- New CSS classes: `.rec-bets-card`, `.rec-bet-item`, `.rec-bet-tag`, `.rec-tag-best`, `.rec-tag-value`, `.rec-tag-pass`, `.rec-bet-summary`

## Part 5: Default Track Bias
- Added `defaultBias` to AQU TRACKS entry: `{ surface: "Fast", rail: "Inside", style: "Speed" }` — AQU spring dirt favors inside speed
- Added `defaultBias` to SAR TRACKS entry: `{ surface: "Fast", rail: "Neutral", style: "No Bias" }` — Saratoga generally fair
- `runAdviceEngine()` now falls back to `TRACKS[code].defaultBias` when no manual bias log entry exists for today
- This ensures the 10% bias factor always has data, even without manual input

## Part 6: Race Type Mapping Fallback in Advice Engine
- Changed `CLASS_SCALE[race.type] || 40` to `CLASS_SCALE[race.type] || CLASS_SCALE[mapRaceTypeToCode(race.type)] || 40`
- Handles both code-format ("MCL") and full-string-format ("Maiden Claiming") race types gracefully

## Files Changed
- `index.html` — All code changes (CSS fix, transform update, helper function, recommended bets card, default bias, class scale fallback)
- `data/entries-AQU-2026-04-16.json` — Enriched with ML odds, Beyer Speed Figures, running styles, jockey/trainer percentages, race type codes, and last class for all 70 horses
