# NE Racing — Changelog

## v2.21.1 — Barn contrast + horse-first hierarchy (2026-04-22)

Focused corrective release against v2.21.0 based on real-device QA
(iPhone 390px): Barn was reading as a Jockey/Trainer/Stable form with
horses buried below the fold, and several text tones on navy were below
readable contrast.

### Fixes
- **Barn is horse-first above the fold**: the Horses section now renders
  with an elevated primary card (gold hairline, larger heading) as the
  first thing after the summary row. Jockeys/Trainers are collapsed
  under a secondary **Connections** accordion, and the Stables card is
  nested inside that accordion instead of dominating the viewport.
- **Load sample horses CTA**: when the Horses list is empty (including
  for legacy v2.20 users who had Jockeys/Trainers but no horses) the
  Barn now shows a prominent "Load sample Saratoga horses" button that
  seeds 14 curated horses from the 2025 SAR sample fixture. The
  auto-seeder was also fixed so a prior skipped attempt (flag set, 0
  horses in barn) retries on next load.
- **Contrast rewrite** (WCAG AA-friendly on navy/cream):
  - Barn section headings upped to solid `#F7F2E6`.
  - Empty-state copy raised from `alpha(0.82)` to solid `#E6DFC9`.
  - Count dots replaced with a solid gold chip.
  - Input placeholders on navy cards now `#B9B3A0`.
  - Footer tip moved off pale-italic-on-cream to solid `#3A4256` text on
    a soft navy tint pill.
  - Meta / watch-reason rows now `#DCD6C2` / `#D9D2BC`.
  - Inactive bottom-nav labels/icons lifted from `--lux-ink-mute`
    (`rgba(237,232,220,0.62)`) to solid `#C8C2AD`, icons bumped to 0.9
    opacity, min-height raised to 56px.
  - Upcoming-at-SAR card: gold accents solidified, row text brightened,
    empty-state italic replaced with plain readable copy.
- **Tap targets**:
  - `.icon-btn` (top-bar gear, track pill, close buttons) now
    guaranteed ≥44×44px via `min-width`/`min-height`/flex centering.
  - Bottom-nav buttons min-height 56px.
  - Barn add-row inputs/buttons raised to 44px min height.
  - Barn `Remove` button raised to 44px; `Open` button in Upcoming row
    raised to 36px with proper hit area.
- **Richer horse profile**: profile modal now has three collapsible
  sections — **Overview**, **Sample history**, and **Notes & tags**.
  Overview is a definition-list grid of Jockey / Trainer / Owner /
  Age-Sex / Style / ML / sample-start count, with chips for quick
  scanning. Sample history preserves every fixture field we have per
  entry: date, track, race, post time, distance, surface, conditions,
  purse, post position, weight, morning line, scratched flag, plus
  jockey / trainer / owner for that race. Missing fields render as
  *"not in sample"* rather than invented data.
- **In-race highlighting preserved**: the gold left-stripe and "In Barn"
  pill for horses in the active race card continue to work.

### Internal
- `version.json` bumped to `20260422-2200-virtual-barn-v2.21.1`.
- `RAILBIRD_VERSION` / `NE_APP_VERSION` bumped in `index.html`.
- `buildDemoHorsesFromFixture()` now carries per-race connection fields
  (jockey, trainer, owner, pp, weight, ml, purse, conditions, postTime,
  scratched) into the horse history so the profile modal has something
  to render.
- `seedDemoHorses()` accepts `{force:true}` and the CTA / settings
  re-seed path uses it. The auto-seed path also retries when the flag
  is set but the barn is still empty.
- `window.__augmentBarn` now exposed so the seed CTA can refresh
  Stables/Upcoming cards after seeding.

### Out of scope / known limitations
- No new data sources, no Worker deploy. The Worker token is unavailable
  in this release loop; CORS / auth remain as shipped in v2.21.0.
- "Sample history" is explicitly scheduled-entry data from the 2025 SAR
  placeholder set. No finish positions / beaten lengths / speed figs
  are shown because the fixture does not contain them.

## v2.21.0 — Virtual Barn + QC remediation (2026-04-22)

### Features
- **Virtual Barn**: the Barn tab is now horse-first. Each followed horse has a
  full profile (notes, tags, watch reason, favorite, history/timeline).
  Profiles open by tapping a horse name; data persists in localStorage.
- **Demo Saratoga horses**: on first load the Barn is seeded with ~14 curated
  demo horses mined from `data/fixtures/saratoga_2025_sample.json`, each
  labelled `DEMO · Saratoga sample` so nothing gets confused with official
  stats. Skipped if the user already has 3+ horses. Re-seedable via
  `window.virtualBarnSeedDemo()`.
- **In-race highlighting**: when a Virtual Barn horse is entered in the loaded
  card, the row is highlighted with a gold left-stripe and an "In Barn" pill
  (★ Barn for favorites).

### Fixes
- **Auto-update polling bug**: app was reading `d.v` from `version.json`, but
  the file uses `{ "version": "…" }`. Updates were not propagating. Now reads
  `d.version` with a `d.v` legacy fallback.
- **Expert consensus double-count**: `countExpertPicks` / `getExpertNames` now
  match on pp *with fallback* to name (not OR), and dedupe by source so the
  same picker can't be counted twice in one race.
- **Value badge overclaiming**: renamed `Value` → `Overlay` and
  `Strong Value` → `Big Overlay` with tooltips clarifying the badge compares
  morning-line implied probability to the model, not tote odds. No
  calibration claim implied.

### Security / compliance
- **Worker CORS locked** to `https://railbirdai.com` via `wrangler.toml`. The
  Worker now honors an allowlist instead of wildcard `*`.
- **Worker observability enabled** in `wrangler.toml`.
- **Unauthorized scraping disabled**: the Worker's free-mode handlers for
  scratches / live odds / results no longer hit Equibase or NYRA; they
  return `source: "unavailable"` with a graceful empty payload. The
  licensed-adapter code (`fetchFreeScratches`, `fetchFreeOdds`,
  `fetchFreeResults`) is retained as architecture-only for a future
  permitted data feed.
- **Daily entries workflow disabled** — `.github/workflows/daily-entries.yml`
  no longer runs on a cron. Re-enable only against a licensed feed.
- **Dev pages relocated** to `/dev/` (`dev/qc.html`, `dev/debug.html`,
  `dev/clear.html`) and excluded via `robots.txt` — no longer discoverable at
  the apex domain.
- **Stale `APP_VERSION`** constant removed from `sw.js` (the self-destruct SW
  doesn't need a version; the app's `version.json` poll is the source of
  truth).
- **`robots.txt`** added, disallowing `/dev/` and the old root dev pages.

### Accessibility / contrast
- Bumped `--color-muted` from `#636B7F` → `#4A5368` (AA on cream bg).
- Bottom nav labels: larger, bolder, darker color; min-height 52px.
- Barn heart toggle: enlarged tap target (40×40 min).
- Barn empty states, meta, summary labels: higher contrast (`0.82`/`0.85`
  alpha) + added aria-labels.
- Barn item remove: bumped font-size + min-height for mobile.

### Testing
- Added `scripts/lib/advice-utils.js` — a tiny, dependency-free pure module
  holding expert-consensus matching, overlay classification, and exotic
  box-cost combinatorics.
- Added `tests/advice-utils.test.js` + `tests/fixture.test.js` using
  `node:test`. 17 tests covering consensus matching, value thresholds,
  exotic math, and the Saratoga fixture shape. Run with `node --test tests/`.

## v2.16 — Landing hero no-grey-flash (2026-04-17)

### Fix
- Landing page used to show a grey blurred placeholder before the hero photo loaded (visible for ~1 second). Root cause: the inline `<img>` had a heavily blurred base64 LQIP that rendered as grey while the real hero WebP was only `prefetch`ed (low priority).
- Now the hero key is picked in a head-level inline script, and the chosen WebP is `preload`ed with `fetchpriority="high"` so the browser starts downloading it before the stylesheet block is parsed.
- `#hero-screen-bg` gets a solid dark-navy floor so any time the photo isn't yet decoded, the user sees the luxury title on navy (matching the vignette) — never a grey wash.
- The hero loader JS now starts with `opacity: 0` and fades in once the full-res image decodes. Removed the CSS `hero-img-in` keyframe that was animating against the blurred placeholder.

---

## v2.4 — Scroll Fix + App Icon (2026-04-14)

### Features
- Added PWA manifest (`manifest.json`) with proper app name "NE Racing Companion"
- Added Saratoga-themed app icon (gold jockey on racing green) for home screen: 192x192, 512x512, 180x180 Apple touch icon, plus favicons
- Added `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tags for standalone mode on iOS
- Updated `theme-color` to racing green `#1B4332`

### Fixes
- "Let's Go" now scrolls to land cleanly on Today's Ticket (or main content), accounting for sticky header height, instead of showing header chrome
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure DOM is painted before calculating scroll position

---

## v2.3 — Cache Fix (2026-04-14)

### Fix
- Rewrote `sw.js` to use network-first for ALL requests (not just HTML). Old cache-first strategy for assets caused stale content to persist.
- Removed hardcoded `APP_VERSION` from `sw.js` — the SW no longer needs version coupling with `index.html`.
- On activate, the new SW purges all caches so existing users get fresh content immediately.
- Added `updateViaCache: 'none'` to SW registration so the browser always checks the network for `sw.js` updates.
- Note: `_headers` file is for Cloudflare Pages and has no effect on GitHub Pages. Cache busting relies on the SW + version.json polling.

---

## v2.2 — Polish Pass (2026-04-14)

### Fixes
- Welcome overlay scroll bleed-through — hidden via `display: none` after "Let's Go"
- LIVE odds column hidden when Worker URL is placeholder
- Exotic bet horse pills grouped by race with headers
- Reference tab meet badges: Completed / Active / Upcoming based on date
- Dynamic hero subtitle based on selected track and season
- Advice onboarding hint updated to mention checkboxes with pulse animation
- All "Bet Slip" references renamed to "Bets"

---

## v2.1 — Bug Fix (2026-04-14)

### Fix
- Fixed `fieldSize` reference bug in advice engine rendering: `horses.length` was referencing an out-of-scope variable from the scoring loop, causing confidence calibration in the race-panel rendering to use an undefined value. Changed to `scored.length` which correctly reflects the non-scratched field size.
- Bumped app version to `20260414-1400`.

---

## v2.0 — Major Upgrade (2026-04-14)

### Task 1: Expert Handicapper Picks
- New `/api/expert-picks` endpoint in `worker.js` (fetches from static JSON or returns empty gracefully)
- `expertPicks` array added to each race in the data model (source, pick PP, horse name)
- Expert Consensus section in each race's advice panel showing who picked whom
- HIGH CONVICTION badge (`.badge-conviction`) when engine's top pick matches 2+ expert picks
- Expert picks referenced in Today's Ticket card ("Aragona & DeSantis both pick him")

### Task 2: Today's Ticket Redesign
- Replaced generic Recommended Bets card with ticket-themed "Today's Ticket" card
- Three bet categories: Best Bet (5% bankroll), Value Play ($2 EX Box), Action Bet (2% bankroll)
- Plain-English one-sentence reasons for every recommendation (no numeric scores on ticket)
- PASS section listing races with no clear edge (gap < 5, low completeness, or auto-PASS)
- "Copy Ticket" button copies clean text summary to clipboard
- Est. Cost / Budget / Remaining summary footer
- Maximum 4 recommendations per day (1 Best + up to 2 Value + 1 Action)

### Task 3: Deeper Advice Engine
- **Data completeness penalty**: 7-point check (3 speed figs, running style, jockey%, trainer%, lastClass). <50% = 15% penalty, <30% = 30% penalty
- **Freshness factor** (5% weight): 14-28 days = 80 (ideal), 7-13d = 65, 29-60d = 55, 61-90d = 35, 90+ = 20. Pace reduced to 15%
- **Equipment change bonus**: +5 to composite (capped at 100) when equipmentChanges is non-empty
- **Improved confidence calibration**: High requires gap > 12 AND completeness >= 70% AND field >= 5. Medium requires gap > 6 AND completeness >= 50%. Else Low
- **Auto-PASS**: When confidence is Low AND top score < 60
- **Expert consensus boost**: +8 if 2+ experts match, +4 if 1 expert matches
- Updated Reference tab methodology table with new weights and modifiers

### Task 4: Workout Data Display
- `workouts` array added to horse data model (date, distance, time, surface, rank, note)
- Workout table in Horse Detail Modal showing recent workouts
- Bullet workout indicator (lightning bolt) next to horse name in entry table
- Bullet workouts mentioned in advice rationale

### Task 5: Daily Data Pipeline
- `.github/workflows/daily-entries.yml`: Runs 8 AM ET weekdays, triggers `scripts/build-entries.js`
- `scripts/build-entries.js`: Node.js script (zero npm deps) that fetches NYRA entries, cross-references jockey/trainer stats, assigns running styles, fetches expert picks, outputs enriched JSON
- `data/jockey-stats.json`: Top 50 NYRA circuit jockeys with trailing 12-month stats
- `data/trainer-stats.json`: Top 50 NYRA circuit trainers with trailing 12-month stats

### Task 6: UX Fixes
- **6a**: Sync info hidden in manual mode (`syncInfo.classList.add('hidden')` when `dataMode === 'manual'`)
- **6b**: No change needed — gear icon and track pill already work correctly
- **6c**: Loading indicator (pulsing dot + "Loading entries...") shown during live data fetch
- **6d**: Equibase deep links per race card ("View on Equibase" link in race header)

### Task 7: Accuracy Tracking
- `ne-racing-accuracy` localStorage key tracks best bet wins, value play ROI, expert consensus record, action bet record
- Updated Advice Report Card in Results tab: Best Bet Record, Expert Consensus Record, Value Play ROI, Action Bet Record
- `storeTicketPicks()` saves daily ticket picks for cross-referencing with results
- `updateAccuracyTracking()` called on every result update

### Data File Changes
- `data/entries-AQU-2026-04-16.json`: Added `expertPicks` (per race), `equibaseUrl` (per race), `lastRaceDate`, `equipmentChanges`, `workouts` (per horse) for all 70 entries across 8 races

### Worker Changes
- `worker.js`: New `/api/expert-picks` endpoint, `transformStaticEntries()` passes through expertPicks, equibaseUrl, and all new horse-level fields

## v1.x — Previous Changes (2026-04-14)

## Part 1: CSS Navigation Bug Fix
- **Moved** `#desktop-nav { display: none; }` **before** the `@media (min-width: 768px)` query so the responsive rule properly overrides on desktop
- Desktop nav (Today, Bets, Handicap, Results, Reference) now renders at ≥768px
- Mobile bottom tab bar continues to render at <768px — verified at 375px viewport

## Part 2: Enriched JSON Data Format
- Added `race_type_code` to each race object (MCL, CLM, MSW, AOC, ALW)
- Added per-horse fields: `ml`, `speedFigs`, `runningStyle`, `jockeyPct`, `trainerPct`, `lastClass`
- All 70 horses across 8 races populated with researched data from Equibase, NYRA, DRF, and BloodHorse sources
- Jockey win percentages based on trailing 12-month NYRA circuit stats (21 jockeys)
- Trainer win percentages from NYRA meet leaders (23 trainers from research + reasonable estimates for 24 smaller barns)
- Beyer Speed Figures sourced from past performances; estimated from class level for horses without published figs
- Running styles assigned from past-performance running lines

## Part 3: Updated `transformStaticEntries()` + `mapRaceTypeToCode()`
- Added `mapRaceTypeToCode()` helper that fuzzy-matches race_type strings ("Maiden Claiming" → "MCL", etc.)
- Updated `transformStaticEntries()` to map `race_type_code` directly, falling back to `mapRaceTypeToCode(race_type)`
- Horse mapping now includes: `id`, `speedFigs`, `runningStyle`, `jockeyPct`, `trainerPct`, `lastClass`, `notes`, `wps`
- Race `type` field now resolves to CLASS_SCALE-compatible codes

## Part 4: Recommended Bets Card + Pass Logic
- **New card** (`#rec-bets-card`) replaces the old Top Picks card at the top of the Today tab
- **Best Bet of the Day**: Horse with highest composite score where gap > 15 (High confidence). Falls back to widest gap with Medium/Low label
- **Value Plays**: Horses ranked #1 or #2 with ML ≥ 5-1 AND composite score ≥ 65. Includes exacta box suggestion with #2 horse
- **Pass Races**: Any race where score gap < 7 between #1 and #2 is marked "PASS — No clear edge. Save your bankroll."
- **Daily Ticket Summary**: Shows estimated cost, daily budget (20% of bankroll), and remaining budget
- Suggested bet amount: 5% of bankroll for Best Bet
- Visual style matches racing green/gold/white design language
- New CSS classes: `.rec-bets-card`, `.rec-bet-item`, `.rec-bet-tag`, `.rec-tag-best`, `.rec-tag-value`, `.rec-tag-pass`, `.rec-bet-summary`

## Part 5: Default Track Bias
- Added `defaultBias` to AQU TRACKS entry: `{ surface: "Fast", rail: "Inside", style: "Speed" }` — AQU spring dirt favors inside speed
- Added `defaultBias` to SAR TRACKS entry: `{ surface: "Fast", rail: "Neutral", style: "No Bias" }` — Saratoga generally fair
- `runAdviceEngine()` now falls back to `TRACKS[code].defaultBias` when no manual bias log entry exists for today
- This ensures the 10% bias factor always has data, even without manual input

## Part 6: Race Type Mapping Fallback in Advice Engine
- Changed `CLASS_SCALE[race.type] || 40` to `CLASS_SCALE[race.type] || CLASS_SCALE[mapRaceTypeToCode(race.type)] || 40`
- Handles both code-format ("MCL") and full-string-format ("Maiden Claiming") race types gracefully

## Files Changed
- `index.html` — All code changes (CSS fix, transform update, helper function, recommended bets card, default bias, class scale fallback)
- `data/entries-AQU-2026-04-16.json` — Enriched with ML odds, Beyer Speed Figures, running styles, jockey/trainer percentages, race type codes, and last class for all 70 horses
